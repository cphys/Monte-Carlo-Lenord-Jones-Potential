# Project Title

This project was done to introduce Mean Field approximation of various 2D lattice models using a Lenord Jones potential. Compares accuracy and number of computation cycles of various numerical methods.

## Getting Started

* Running lenJonesPot.nb will prompt the user to select a pre defined lattice. The program will output a plot of the Potential profile,  
  the lattice structure, a data table and plot showing the accuracy and convergence rates of various approximation methods, as well as  
  a plot showing the lattice spacing for which the energy is minimized.

* The Energy in the limit of long length scales and the value of the lattice spacing for which the Energy is minimized will also be given as outputs. 

## Getting Started

* It is fairly straight forward to add new lattice structures. A hexagonal lattice structure would be usefull in studies of graphene.

## Acknowledgments

* Part of this code comes from an assignment in a Mathmatical methods in physics course taken at the University of Rhode Island.
